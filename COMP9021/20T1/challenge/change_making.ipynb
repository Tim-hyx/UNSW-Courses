    "Given a number of face values $v_1$, ..., $v_k$ with $v_1<\\dots v_k$, $n_1$ coins with face value $\\$v_1$, ..., $n_k$ coins with face value $\\$v_k$, and a positive integer $x$, we want to get all combinations of available coins that amount to $\\$ x$ with the minimal of coins (there can be no solution, a unique solution, or many solutions). This can be solved using dynamic programming, thanks to an approach that we illustrate for the case where we have at least two coins with face value $\\$1$, exactly two coins with face value $\\$2$, at least three coins with face value $\\$3$, at least one coin with face value $\\$5$, and a desired amount of $\\$9$.

The entries in the superdiagonal (that is, the cells at the intersection of the $\\$1$ row and the $\\$1$ column,  at the intersection of the $\\$2$ row and the $\\$2$ column, ...), give the solutions for all amounts between $\\$1$ and $\\$9$:\n",
